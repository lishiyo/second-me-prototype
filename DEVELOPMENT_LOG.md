# Development Log

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Current Status
- Refactored the `vector_db.py` to align with the architecture design
- Removed content storage from Weaviate, now only storing metadata and embedding vectors
- Updated Weaviate configuration to use pre-computed embeddings instead of its built-in vectorizer
- Updated corresponding test code to provide mock embeddings
- Added numpy to requirements.txt for generating embeddings in tests

### Commands Run
```bash
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Initial test run showing discrepancy with architecture
pip install numpy  # Added numpy for generating mock embeddings in tests
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Verified all tests passing with updated implementation
```

### Errors Encountered
- Initial test failure when content was removed but embedding vectors weren't provided
- Missing numpy module before it was installed

### Next Steps Planned
- Consider updating all remaining `datetime.utcnow()` calls to use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` to address deprecation warnings
- Add proper cleanup for Weaviate connections in other parts of the code
- Implement the embedding generation service that will create vectors for text chunks
- Create a wrapper for OpenAI's embedding API
- Update the document ingestion pipeline to align with the new architecture
