# Development Log

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Current Status
- Refactored the `vector_db.py` to align with the architecture design
- Removed content storage from Weaviate, now only storing metadata and embedding vectors
- Updated Weaviate configuration to use pre-computed embeddings instead of its built-in vectorizer
- Updated corresponding test code to provide mock embeddings
- Added numpy to requirements.txt for generating embeddings in tests

### Commands Run
```bash
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Initial test run showing discrepancy with architecture
pip install numpy  # Added numpy for generating mock embeddings in tests
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Verified all tests passing with updated implementation
```

### Next Steps Planned
- Consider updating all remaining `datetime.utcnow()` calls to use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` to address deprecation warnings
- Add proper cleanup for Weaviate connections in other parts of the code
- Implement the embedding generation service that will create vectors for text chunks
- Create a wrapper for OpenAI's embedding API
- Update the document ingestion pipeline to align with the new architecture

### Current Status
- Completed detailed planning for the L0 processing pipeline implementation
- Created directory structure plan for the pipeline components
- Defined clear responsibilities for each component (extraction, analysis, chunking, embeddings)
- Mapped storage organization across Wasabi, Weaviate, and PostgreSQL
- Aligned implementation with the architecture design in the v0_architecture.md document

### Commands Run
```bash
# No commands run, focused on design and planning
```

### Next Steps Planned
- Create the basic directory structure for the processors
- Implement the core Chunker class first, adapting the TokenParagraphSplitter from lpm_kernel
- Develop the ContentExtractor with support for common file types
- Create the EmbeddingGenerator using OpenAI's API
- Implement the DocumentAnalyzer for generating document insights
- Build the main DocumentProcessor orchestrator class
- Add comprehensive test coverage for each component
- Integrate with the FastAPI routes for document processing

### Current Status
- Completed Subtask 1: Setup Directory Structure for the L0 processing pipeline
- Completed Subtask 2: Implement Data Models and Utilities
- Created the necessary data models (FileInfo, ChunkInfo, DocumentInsights, ProcessingResult)
- Implemented utility functions for retry logic, error handling, and logging 
- Set up package structure with proper imports and exports
- Created test directory structure for L0 pipeline tests
- Updated requirements.txt with necessary dependencies for the L0 pipeline

### Commands Run
```bash
# Create directory structure
mkdir -p app/processors
touch app/processors/__init__.py
mkdir -p app/processors/l0
touch app/processors/l0/__init__.py
touch app/processors/l0/models.py app/processors/l0/chunker.py app/processors/l0/content_extractor.py app/processors/l0/document_analyzer.py app/processors/l0/embedding_generator.py app/processors/l0/document_processor.py
touch app/processors/l0/utils.py

# Create test directory structure
mkdir -p tests/processors/l0
touch tests/processors/l0/__init__.py
```

### Next Steps Planned
- Implement Subtask 3a: Chunker Implementation
- Implement Subtask 3b: Content Extractor Implementation
- Implement Subtask 3c: Embedding Generator Implementation
- Implement Subtask 3d: Document Analyzer Implementation
- Develop unit tests for each component as they are implemented 

## 2025-04-15 15:45:10 PDT

### Current Status
- Completed Subtask 3: Implemented all L0 Processing Pipeline Components
- Implemented ContentExtractor with support for PDF, DOCX, PPTX, and text formats
- Implemented Chunker with paragraph-based and fixed-size chunking strategies
- Implemented EmbeddingGenerator using OpenAI's embedding API
- Implemented DocumentAnalyzer for extracting document insights
- Implemented DocumentProcessor to orchestrate the entire pipeline
- Added comprehensive unit tests for all components
- Updated package exports in __init__.py files

### Commands Run
```bash
# Implement each component
touch app/processors/l0/content_extractor.py
touch app/processors/l0/chunker.py
touch app/processors/l0/document_analyzer.py
touch app/processors/l0/embedding_generator.py
touch app/processors/l0/document_processor.py

# Create test files
touch tests/processors/l0/test_content_extractor.py
touch tests/processors/l0/test_chunker.py
touch tests/processors/l0/test_document_processor.py
```

### Next Steps Planned
- Run comprehensive tests to ensure all components work together correctly
- Integrate the L0 pipeline with the FastAPI routes for document processing
- Implement storage interfaces for the DocumentProcessor class
- Connect the L0 pipeline to the document ingestion worker
- Add logging and monitoring for the document processing pipeline
