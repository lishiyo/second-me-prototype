# Development Log

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Current Status
- Refactored the `vector_db.py` to align with the architecture design
- Removed content storage from Weaviate, now only storing metadata and embedding vectors
- Updated Weaviate configuration to use pre-computed embeddings instead of its built-in vectorizer
- Updated corresponding test code to provide mock embeddings
- Added numpy to requirements.txt for generating embeddings in tests

### Commands Run
```bash
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Initial test run showing discrepancy with architecture
pip install numpy  # Added numpy for generating mock embeddings in tests
python tests/test_adapters.py  # Verified all tests passing with updated implementation
```

### Errors Encountered
- Initial test failure when content was removed but embedding vectors weren't provided
- Missing numpy module before it was installed

### Next Steps Planned
- Consider updating all remaining `datetime.utcnow()` calls to use `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` to address deprecation warnings
- Add proper cleanup for Weaviate connections in other parts of the code
- Implement the embedding generation service that will create vectors for text chunks
- Create a wrapper for OpenAI's embedding API
- Update the document ingestion pipeline to align with the new architecture

### Current Status
- Completed detailed planning for the L0 processing pipeline implementation
- Created directory structure plan for the pipeline components
- Defined clear responsibilities for each component (extraction, analysis, chunking, embeddings)
- Mapped storage organization across Wasabi, Weaviate, and PostgreSQL
- Aligned implementation with the architecture design in the v0_architecture.md document

### Commands Run
```bash
# No commands run, focused on design and planning
```

### Errors Encountered
- None (planning phase)

### Next Steps Planned
- Create the basic directory structure for the processors
- Implement the core Chunker class first, adapting the TokenParagraphSplitter from lpm_kernel
- Develop the ContentExtractor with support for common file types
- Create the EmbeddingGenerator using OpenAI's API
- Implement the DocumentAnalyzer for generating document insights
- Build the main DocumentProcessor orchestrator class
- Add comprehensive test coverage for each component
- Integrate with the FastAPI routes for document processing
