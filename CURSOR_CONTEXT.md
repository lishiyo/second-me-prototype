# Current Implementation Context

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're currently implementing the data storage architecture as defined in the `v0_architecture.md` document, specifically aligning the VectorDB adapter with the architecture's specification:

> TenantChunk {
>   document_id: String            # Source document ID
>   s3_path: String                # Direct path to chunk file in Wasabi
>   metadata: Object {             # Additional metadata
>     filename: String
>     content_type: String
>     timestamp: DateTime
>     chunk_index: Integer         # Index of chunk in original document
>   }
> }

### What's Working
- BlobStore adapter (Wasabi S3) for storing raw documents and chunks
- VectorDB adapter using Weaviate's multi-tenancy
- Proper tenant isolation in Weaviate
- Pre-computed embedding vector storage in Weaviate
- RelationalDB adapter for user and document metadata
- Test suite for all adapters

### What's Broken
- No major broken functionality at the moment
- Some deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` calls need to be addressed

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers

### Database/Model State
- Weaviate schema now correctly configured for pre-computed embeddings
- Content storage removed from Weaviate to align with architecture
- PostgreSQL schema is working correctly for storing user and document metadata
- Wasabi S3 configured correctly for blob storage

### Section Being Implemented
We're now planning the L0 processing pipeline as described in the `v0_L0_flow.md` document. This is the first major processing component that handles:

1. Document ingestion and storage
2. Content extraction
3. Document analysis (insights, title, summary)
4. Document chunking
5. Embedding generation
6. Vector database storage

We're following the example code from `lpm_kernel` but adapting it to our architecture with Wasabi, Weaviate, and PostgreSQL.

### What's Working
- Core adapters (BlobStore, VectorDB, RelationalDB) are implemented and tested
- Basic architectural alignment is in place
- Detailed implementation plan for L0 pipeline is complete

### What's Broken
- None yet - we're in planning/implementation phase for the pipeline

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Storage structure planned:
  - Wasabi: Will store raw documents, chunks as separate files, and metadata
  - Weaviate: Will store embeddings and pointers to chunks in Wasabi
  - PostgreSQL: Will track document metadata and processing status

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the L0 processing pipeline following the plan in `v0_L0_instructions.md`. We've completed the first two subtasks:

1. ✅ Subtask 1: Setup Directory Structure - Created all required directories and files
2. ✅ Subtask 2: Implement Data Models and Utilities - Created data models and utility functions

And we're now prepared to implement the core processing components:

3. Subtask 3a-d: Implementing core components (Chunker, ContentExtractor, EmbeddingGenerator, DocumentAnalyzer)

### What's Working
- Directory structure for L0 processing pipeline is set up
- Data models are implemented:
  - ProcessingStatus enum
  - FileInfo class
  - ChunkInfo class
  - DocumentInsights class
  - ProcessingResult class
- Utility functions are implemented:
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Error handling helpers
  - Logging configuration
  - URL encoding/decoding for chunking

### What's Broken
- None - the implemented code is ready for testing once components are completed

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- No changes to database state yet
- Data models are ready for use by processing components

### Section Being Implemented
We're fixing and improving the L0 processing pipeline tests, particularly addressing model issues in the document processor module. We're aligning the model implementation with its usage to ensure the pipeline works correctly.

### What's Working
- Refactored document analysis model into two separate models:
  - DocumentInsight for first-stage deep insights
  - DocumentSummary for second-stage summaries and keywords 
- ChunkInfo model now includes metadata field to match how it's used in document_processor.py
- Fixed tests to mock the chunker correctly, returning dictionaries that are then converted to ChunkInfo
- Test pipeline correctly processes real documents with the new model structure
- Document insights and summary extraction are fully functional

### What's Broken
- No current breakage after fixes

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Models improved for better alignment with implementation:
  - ChunkInfo with metadata support
  - DocumentInsight for deep document analysis
  - DocumentSummary for easier consumption 
- Test data model represents real-world documents

### Section Being Implemented
We've completed the L0 processing pipeline implementation (subtasks 1-6 from v0_L0_instructions.md) and are ready to move to L1 implementation. We're skipping Subtask 7 (FastAPI integration) for now as specified in the instructions.

### What's Working
- Complete L0 processing pipeline implementation:
  - Content extraction from various file formats
  - Document analysis with AI-generated insights and summaries
  - Document chunking with semantic boundaries
  - Embedding generation for vector search
  - Full integration with all storage systems
- Enhanced document model with title, insight, and summary fields
- Two-stage document analysis (deep insight + summary)
- Storage of document metadata in both PostgreSQL and Wasabi
- Document creation and status tracking in the database
- Comprehensive test coverage with real documents

### What's Broken
- Nothing is broken in the current implementation

### Current Blockers
- No blockers for moving to L1 implementation

### Database/Model State
- PostgreSQL schema updated with new document fields:
  - title: Document title extracted from content
  - insight: JSON field containing deep AI-generated insights
  - summary: JSON field containing summary and keywords
- Wasabi storage structure properly organized:
  - Raw documents in tenant/{user_id}/raw/
  - Document chunks in tenant/{user_id}/chunks/{document_id}/
  - Document insights and summaries in tenant/{user_id}/metadata/{document_id}/
- Weaviate vector database populated with:
  - Document chunk embeddings
  - Metadata and pointers to Wasabi for chunk retrieval

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the L1 processing pipeline as outlined in `v0_L1_flow.md`. Currently focusing on the L1GenerationResult model to ensure it's compatible with lpm_kernel's implementation while making necessary improvements for our architecture.

### What's Working
- L1GenerationResult model with proper structure aligned with lpm_kernel:
  - Updated field name from generated_at to generate_time
  - Changed chunk_topics from List to Dict format as per lpm_kernel
  - Implemented to_dict() and from_dict() methods with proper serialization
  - Added factory methods success() and failure() for easier result creation
- Bio model with health_status field
- Topic and Chunk models now have s3_path fields to point to Wasabi urls
- Proper serialization and deserialization for all L1 models
- Test suite for the L1 models passing successfully

### What's Broken
- Nothing broken in the current implementation

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- L1 models defined and aligned with lpm_kernel structure:
  - Note and Chunk for document representation
  - Topic, Cluster, and Memory for topic modeling
  - Shade, ShadeInfo, ShadeMergeInfo for personality aspects
  - Bio for user biography in multiple perspectives
  - L1GenerationResult for encapsulating the full L1 generation process
- Database adapters planned but not fully implemented:
  - PostgreSQL for structured L1 data (versions, biographies, etc.)
  - Wasabi for storing serialized L1 objects
  - Weaviate for vector representations of L1 entities
