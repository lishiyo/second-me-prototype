# Current Implementation Context

### Section Being Implemented
We're currently implementing the data storage architecture as defined in the `v0_architecture.md` document, specifically aligning the VectorDB adapter with the architecture's specification:

> TenantChunk {
>   document_id: String            # Source document ID
>   s3_path: String                # Direct path to chunk file in Wasabi
>   metadata: Object {             # Additional metadata
>     filename: String
>     content_type: String
>     timestamp: DateTime
>     chunk_index: Integer         # Index of chunk in original document
>   }
> }

### What's Working
- BlobStore adapter (Wasabi S3) for storing raw documents and chunks
- VectorDB adapter using Weaviate's multi-tenancy
- Proper tenant isolation in Weaviate
- Pre-computed embedding vector storage in Weaviate
- RelationalDB adapter for user and document metadata
- Test suite for all adapters

### What's Broken
- No major broken functionality at the moment
- Some deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` calls need to be addressed

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers

### Database/Model State
- Weaviate schema now correctly configured for pre-computed embeddings
- Content storage removed from Weaviate to align with architecture
- PostgreSQL schema is working correctly for storing user and document metadata
- Wasabi S3 configured correctly for blob storage
