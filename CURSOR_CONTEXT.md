# Current Implementation Context

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're currently implementing the data storage architecture as defined in the `v0_architecture.md` document, specifically aligning the VectorDB adapter with the architecture's specification:

> TenantChunk {
>   document_id: String            # Source document ID
>   s3_path: String                # Direct path to chunk file in Wasabi
>   metadata: Object {             # Additional metadata
>     filename: String
>     content_type: String
>     timestamp: DateTime
>     chunk_index: Integer         # Index of chunk in original document
>   }
> }

### What's Working
- BlobStore adapter (Wasabi S3) for storing raw documents and chunks
- VectorDB adapter using Weaviate's multi-tenancy
- Proper tenant isolation in Weaviate
- Pre-computed embedding vector storage in Weaviate
- RelationalDB adapter for user and document metadata
- Test suite for all adapters

### What's Broken
- No major broken functionality at the moment
- Some deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` calls need to be addressed

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers

### Database/Model State
- Weaviate schema now correctly configured for pre-computed embeddings
- Content storage removed from Weaviate to align with architecture
- PostgreSQL schema is working correctly for storing user and document metadata
- Wasabi S3 configured correctly for blob storage

### Section Being Implemented
We're now planning the L0 processing pipeline as described in the `v0_L0_flow.md` document. This is the first major processing component that handles:

1. Document ingestion and storage
2. Content extraction
3. Document analysis (insights, title, summary)
4. Document chunking
5. Embedding generation
6. Vector database storage

We're following the example code from `lpm_kernel` but adapting it to our architecture with Wasabi, Weaviate, and PostgreSQL.

### What's Working
- Core adapters (BlobStore, VectorDB, RelationalDB) are implemented and tested
- Basic architectural alignment is in place
- Detailed implementation plan for L0 pipeline is complete

### What's Broken
- None yet - we're in planning/implementation phase for the pipeline

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Storage structure planned:
  - Wasabi: Will store raw documents, chunks as separate files, and metadata
  - Weaviate: Will store embeddings and pointers to chunks in Wasabi
  - PostgreSQL: Will track document metadata and processing status

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the L0 processing pipeline following the plan in `v0_L0_instructions.md`. We've completed the first two subtasks:

1. ✅ Subtask 1: Setup Directory Structure - Created all required directories and files
2. ✅ Subtask 2: Implement Data Models and Utilities - Created data models and utility functions

And we're now prepared to implement the core processing components:

3. Subtask 3a-d: Implementing core components (Chunker, ContentExtractor, EmbeddingGenerator, DocumentAnalyzer)

### What's Working
- Directory structure for L0 processing pipeline is set up
- Data models are implemented:
  - ProcessingStatus enum
  - FileInfo class
  - ChunkInfo class
  - DocumentInsights class
  - ProcessingResult class
- Utility functions are implemented:
  - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
  - Error handling helpers
  - Logging configuration
  - URL encoding/decoding for chunking

### What's Broken
- None - the implemented code is ready for testing once components are completed

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- No changes to database state yet
- Data models are ready for use by processing components

### Section Being Implemented
We're fixing and improving the L0 processing pipeline tests, particularly addressing model issues in the document processor module. We're aligning the model implementation with its usage to ensure the pipeline works correctly.

### What's Working
- Refactored document analysis model into two separate models:
  - DocumentInsight for first-stage deep insights
  - DocumentSummary for second-stage summaries and keywords 
- ChunkInfo model now includes metadata field to match how it's used in document_processor.py
- Fixed tests to mock the chunker correctly, returning dictionaries that are then converted to ChunkInfo
- Test pipeline correctly processes real documents with the new model structure
- Document insights and summary extraction are fully functional

### What's Broken
- No current breakage after fixes

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Models improved for better alignment with implementation:
  - ChunkInfo with metadata support
  - DocumentInsight for deep document analysis
  - DocumentSummary for easier consumption 
- Test data model represents real-world documents
