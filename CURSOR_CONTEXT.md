# Current Implementation Context

## 2025-04-12 23:50:39 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're currently implementing the data storage architecture as defined in the `v0_architecture.md` document, specifically aligning the VectorDB adapter with the architecture's specification:

> TenantChunk {
>   document_id: String            # Source document ID
>   s3_path: String                # Direct path to chunk file in Wasabi
>   metadata: Object {             # Additional metadata
>     filename: String
>     content_type: String
>     timestamp: DateTime
>     chunk_index: Integer         # Index of chunk in original document
>   }
> }

### What's Working
- BlobStore adapter (Wasabi S3) for storing raw documents and chunks
- VectorDB adapter using Weaviate's multi-tenancy
- Proper tenant isolation in Weaviate
- Pre-computed embedding vector storage in Weaviate
- RelationalDB adapter for user and document metadata
- Test suite for all adapters

### What's Broken
- No major broken functionality at the moment
- Some deprecation warnings for `datetime.utcnow()` calls need to be addressed

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers

### Database/Model State
- Weaviate schema now correctly configured for pre-computed embeddings
- Content storage removed from Weaviate to align with architecture
- PostgreSQL schema is working correctly for storing user and document metadata
- Wasabi S3 configured correctly for blob storage

### Section Being Implemented
We're now planning the L0 processing pipeline as described in the `v0_L0_flow.md` document. This is the first major processing component that handles:

1. Document ingestion and storage
2. Content extraction
3. Document analysis (insights, title, summary)
4. Document chunking
5. Embedding generation
6. Vector database storage

We're following the example code from `lpm_kernel` but adapting it to our architecture with Wasabi, Weaviate, and PostgreSQL.

### What's Working
- Core adapters (BlobStore, VectorDB, RelationalDB) are implemented and tested
- Basic architectural alignment is in place
- Detailed implementation plan for L0 pipeline is complete

### What's Broken
- None yet - we're in planning/implementation phase for the pipeline

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Storage structure planned:
  - Wasabi: Will store raw documents, chunks as separate files, and metadata
  - Weaviate: Will store embeddings and pointers to chunks in Wasabi
  - PostgreSQL: Will track document metadata and processing status

  - DocumentInsight for first-stage deep insights
  - DocumentSummary for second-stage summaries and keywords 
- ChunkInfo model now includes metadata field to match how it's used in document_processor.py
- Fixed tests to mock the chunker correctly, returning dictionaries that are then converted to ChunkInfo
- Test pipeline correctly processes real documents with the new model structure
- Document insights and summary extraction are fully functional

### What's Broken
- No current breakage after fixes

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- Models improved for better alignment with implementation:
  - ChunkInfo with metadata support
  - DocumentInsight for deep document analysis
  - DocumentSummary for easier consumption 
- Test data model represents real-world documents

## 2025-04-15 19:35:42 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the L1 processing pipeline as outlined in `v0_L1_flow.md`. Currently focusing on the L1GenerationResult model to ensure it's compatible with lpm_kernel's implementation while making necessary improvements for our architecture.

### What's Working
- L1GenerationResult model with proper structure aligned with lpm_kernel:
  - Updated field name from generated_at to generate_time
  - Changed chunk_topics from List to Dict format as per lpm_kernel
  - Implemented to_dict() and from_dict() methods with proper serialization
  - Added factory methods success() and failure() for easier result creation
- Bio model with health_status field
- Topic and Chunk models now have s3_path fields to point to Wasabi urls
- Proper serialization and deserialization for all L1 models
- Test suite for the L1 models passing successfully

### What's Broken
- Nothing broken in the current implementation

### Current Blockers
- None

### Database/Model State
- L1 models defined and aligned with lpm_kernel structure:
  - Note and Chunk for document representation
  - Topic, Cluster, and Memory for topic modeling
  - Shade, ShadeInfo, ShadeMergeInfo for personality aspects
  - Bio for user biography in multiple perspectives
  - L1GenerationResult for encapsulating the full L1 generation process
- Database adapters planned but not fully implemented:
  - PostgreSQL for structured L1 data (versions, biographies, etc.)
  - Wasabi for storing serialized L1 objects
  - Weaviate for vector representations of L1 entities 

## 2025-04-16 10:45:23 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the Core Processing Phase (Phase 2) of the L1 layer as outlined in `v0_L1_instructions.md`. Specifically, we've set up the foundation for the L1Manager which orchestrates the entire L1 generation process and fixed testing issues for proper integration with our storage stack.

### What's Working
- L1Manager initialization and dependency injection
- Basic orchestration logic for the L1 generation process
- Proper error handling and result status tracking
- Integration with our storage adapters (PostgresAdapter, WasabiStorageAdapter, WeaviateAdapter)
- VectorDB mocking in tests (fixed patching issue)
- All 9 tests for L1Manager are passing
- Factory methods for L1GenerationResult creation (success/failure)

### What's Broken
- Nothing is currently broken in the implemented code
- Some methods in L1Manager are still stub implementations that need actual logic:
  - _extract_notes_from_l0 currently returns empty lists
  - _store_l1_data is implemented as a pass method

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers for continued implementation

### Database/Model State
- L1 data models fully defined and tested:
  - Note and Chunk for document representation
  - Topic, Cluster for topic modeling
  - Shade for personality aspects
  - Bio for user biography
  - L1GenerationResult for process results
- L1Manager provides the orchestration layer connecting all components
- Tests verify proper integration with storage adapters and LLM-based generation
- Next implementation focus is on the data flow between L0 and L1 layers 

## 2025-04-17 15:10:26 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the Core Processing Phase (Phase 2) of the L1 layer, specifically focusing on the data flow between L0 and L1 by making the extraction of notes from L0 data fully functional. We've also improved the architecture by implementing proper dependency injection across all components.

### What's Working
- Proper dependency injection for all L1 generator components (requiring dependencies rather than creating them internally)
- L1Manager._extract_notes_from_l0 method fully functional with real data
- WasabiStorageAdapter.get_document correctly fetches raw document content
- Note creation pipeline with proper embeddings and chunks
- Memory list generation for clustering algorithms
- Full test script with real database connections shows data is correctly extracted

### What's Broken
- Nothing is currently broken in the implemented code
- Still need to implement L1Manager._store_l1_data for the full pipeline to work
- The generate_l1_from_l0 method needs testing with real data

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers for continued implementation

### Database/Model State
- L1 generator components now strictly require their dependencies:
  - LLMService for generating content
  - WasabiStorageAdapter for accessing document storage
  - Storage adapters are properly shared across components
- Note model populated with document data:
  - Raw content from Wasabi
  - Document embedding from Weaviate
  - Chunk data with embeddings from Weaviate
  - Metadata from PostgreSQL and Wasabi
  - Proper compatibility with lpm_kernel field names
- Next implementation focus is on implementing the L1Manager._store_l1_data method to complete the pipeline 

## 2025-04-18 16:20:14 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're fixing a critical issue in the L1 processing pipeline related to how embeddings are handled. Specifically, we've discovered that Weaviate returns embeddings as dictionaries with a 'default' key rather than as direct vector arrays, which was causing issues in our model classes.

### What's Working
- Identified the source of the embedding format issue through detailed logging
- Implemented a transformation at the boundary layer in all Weaviate adapter methods
- Created a centralized utility method (extract_embedding_from_dict) in VectorDB for consistent processing
- Updated all model classes (Topic, Memory, Chunk, Note, Cluster) with proper embedding validation
- Added robust error handling that fails fast with clear error messages
- Fixed memory_list creation in l1_manager.py to handle embedding dictionary format
- Successfully tested with real documents using test_document_embedding.py script

### What's Broken
- Nothing is currently broken after the fixes have been implemented
- Previous silent failures with dummy vectors have been replaced with explicit error handling

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers for continued L1 implementation

### Database/Model State
- All model classes now properly handle and validate embeddings:
  - __post_init__ methods check for dictionary formats, invalid shapes, and scalars
  - squeeze methods throw specific errors instead of silently creating dummy vectors
  - Clear error messages identify the problematic embedding and the nature of the issue
- Boundary layer transformation ensures consistent embedding format throughout the application:
  - WeaviateAdapter methods extract actual vectors from Weaviate's dictionary format
  - VectorDB.extract_embedding_from_dict utility provides centralized extraction logic
  - Memory objects, Notes, Chunks, and Topics all receive proper vector data
- Next implementation focus is on thoroughly testing these fixes with the full L1 generation pipeline 

## 2025-04-19 11:45:32 PDT

### Section Being Implemented
We're implementing the L1 processing pipeline, focusing on fixing the ShadeGenerator class to properly handle null values in JSON responses from the LLM service. This is a critical component of the L1Manager's `generate_l1_from_l0` method, which orchestrates the entire L1 generation process.

### What's Working
- ShadeGenerator class now correctly handles null values in JSON responses by providing default empty strings
- The `_parse_shade_response`, `_parse_merged_shades_response`, and `_parse_improved_shade_response` methods have been fixed
- JSON parsing now includes preprocessing to replace Python's `None` with JSON's `null`
- Error handling for JSON parsing failures is more robust with fallback mechanisms
- The `generate_shade` method successfully tested with single shade improvement and multiple shade merging scenarios
- ShadeMerger component successfully identifies and groups similar shades for merging
- Tests are passing for all shade generation and merging functionality

### What's Broken
- Nothing is currently broken in the implemented shade generation components
- BiographyGenerator needs testing with real data
- Full `generate_l1_from_l0` pipeline integration test is pending

### Current Blockers
- No significant blockers for continued L1 implementation

### Database/Model State
- L1Shade model is functioning correctly with proper JSON serialization/deserialization
- Shade data storage interface in Wasabi working for both individual and merged shades
- ShadeMerger correctly calculates center embeddings for merged shade groups
- L1Manager orchestration layer correctly sequences the generate_shade and merge_shades operations
- Next focus is on testing biography generation and the full L1 pipeline end-to-end
