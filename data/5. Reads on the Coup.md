In case you've wisely decided to go live in a TV-free, internet-free cabin for the last week, first of all congratulations, second of all please return (and let me in with you! üò≠ ). 

If you're unwise like me, all you've been doing is doomscrolling reddit, twitter, and news articles for the past few days, because there happened to be a coup on the seat of our elected government by a mob of [white nationalists](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/trump-supporters-racist-symbols-capitol-assault), [far-right militias](https://www.vox.com/recode/22221285/trump-online-capitol-riot-far-right-parler-twitter-facebook), and other [various fine people](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/neo-nazis-qanon-and-camp-auschwitz-a-guide-to-the-hate-symbols-at-the-capitol-riot-1.9434983) hoping to install god-emperor and dubiously-human-excretion Donald J Trump. Since there's been a *lot* of writing on this already, I'm going to try listing some reads that are more tangentially related to everything that's been building up rather than more direct coverage. 

First off though, some fun/useful reads:

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-polices-tepid-response-to-the-capitol-breach-wasnt-an-aberration/
* A big 'no duh', but it's useful to have hard numbers. 'Between May 1 and November 28, 2020, authorities were more than twice as likely to attempt to break up and disperse a left-wing protest than a right-wing one. And in those situations when law enforcement chose to intervene, they were more likely to use force ‚Äî 34 percent of the time with right-wing protests compared with 51 percent of the time for the left.'

[Opinion | Trump and His Party Made the Storming of the Capitol Possible - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/trump-capitol-protests.html) -
* I can't leave off Ezra Klein's first post for the NYTimes! As it turns out, while the rest of us were thinking "there's no way his followers *actually* believe what he's saying" - nope, they were taking him both seriously, *and* literally. 

[the sun is going down and you're getting cold - Garbage Day](https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-sun-is-going-down-and-youre-getting)
* ". . . if there was any particular point to Wednesday‚Äôs insurrection, other than a naked display of fascist racist violence, it was, for most protesters, simply about creating content to put back on the internet." Welcome to 2021, folks. The revolution will not be televised, but it *will* be livestreamed. (And chocking up the engagements. I know there's been some talk about how we've barely progressed in terms of hard tech since the 90s - like come on, why don't we have flying cars and holograms by now - but isn't it pretty amazing that a digital reality that's not even all that immersive, just plaintext off 4chan not even VR or deepfakes, leads to an attempted coup on the government of the United States of America. Wow.)


[The Making of QAnon: A Crowdsourced Conspiracy - bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/07/the-making-of-qanon-a-crowdsourced-conspiracy/) 
* If you want to understand what the fuck has been going on in the last year or two that led up to the coup, you gotta understand the political fanfic-turned-conspiracy-theory QAnon, and this is a good deep dive on their origins and rise. The biggest question for me is why *QAnon*? Versus the entire universe of other conspiracy theories. It did start from 4chan, but [spread far and wide on Reddit and Youtube](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-three-conspiracy-theorists-took-q-sparked-qanon-n900531). A chilling number is that today about 10% of the US population believe in some or all of it, and an even larger figure - 50% of Trump's supporters - believe in Q's ideas like ‚Äútop Democrats are involved in elite sex-trafficking rings.‚Äù The woman who was shot at Capitol Hill was a believer, and [bellingcat's investigation into her ideological journey](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2021/01/08/the-journey-of-ashli-babbitt/) is both instructive and terrifying. If we can't deprogram these people, we're gonna have a bad time.

* More Q coverage - here's a useful set of continually-updated links to journalist David Farrier's coverage of conspiracy theories, from QAnon to celebrity chiefs who turn out to be Neo-Nazis. I especially like [the therapist's view on conspiracy theories](https://www.webworm.co/p/a-therapists-view-of-conspiracy-theories) and his interview with [a QAnon mole](https://www.webworm.co/p/faking-it-qanon-from-the-inside). 

https://diff.substack.com/p/big-tech-sees-like-a-state
This is a very long read written two months before the attack on Capitol Hill, but it's really come into my thoughts again with a certain someone getting kicked off every tech platform on earth (no seriously, [even Spotify don't want him](https://twitter.com/KarateSkool/status/1347951629878915072)). It compares the tech giants to the governments in *Seeing Like a State*, a fascinating book describing how distant centralized governments impose abstract rules on informal systems that previously functioned off local knowledge ("metis") in order to create more legible, orderly, and scalable systems. Tech companies try to impose the kind of order that makes sense in database schema, but machine-learning algos and the way that users inevitably use things in unexpected ways actually harkens *back* to the local metis-based systems... except now we're way above Dunbar numbers, which makes me remember Ezra Klein's argument that [Twitter's "context collapse"](https://www.vox.com/technology/2018/8/8/17661368/sarah-jeong-twitter-new-york-times-andrew-sullivan) is a big part of the problem with the platform. "We write for an audience we think we know, in a vernacular they‚Äôll understand, using reference points they‚Äôre familiar with. Six years later, our tweets are weaponized to an audience we don‚Äôt know, thick with terms they understand differently, with the reference points completely absent." 

[Telegram has a Nazi problem](https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/) - well, fuck. I was cheering about Parler getting kicked off but it looks like they still have options. And it's already Russian! Very convenient. 

https://www.vulture.com/article/american-dirt-jeanine-cummins-book-controversy.html
* Adding this here because "cancel culture" is something that the right obsess about. I'm conflicted about the term because I suspect it's often just Trumpers complaining about not being able to get away with calling people the N-word and moaning about the gays in polite society anymore. On the other hand, I do hate Twitter's bloodlust to label someone a Very Bad Person Forever and deprive them of their livelihood for a stupid (or just context-uncollapsed, as mentioned above) comment they may have made ten years ago. (I don't necessarily mean famous comedians or celebrities whose jobs have always encompassed a degree of public opinion management, but ordinary people like [Justine Sacco](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html) ... just a lot of energy going into punching down and sideways while the worst president in history promises white supremacists he loves them). But I think this piece about American Dirt goes really well into why this book was problematic and how the publishing industry has a massive problem with diversity. When gatekeepers look for works that "resonate" with them, "them" being almost all white, is it any surprise they tend to respond better to white authors? It reminds me of the tech industry and the common desire by interviewers for a "culture" fit. This is a good example of white privilege and the value of a medium like social media, which doesn't have the same gatekeepers, in generating awareness of it - it's not about trying to deprive a white author of her book deal and riches, it's about asking why other authors are so routinely passed over for the same opportunities. 

[Chicago Police: A History of Violence and Racism - Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/chicago-police-racism-violence-history-1088559/) 
* Remember how the [Chicago police union's boss came out in support of the MAGA terrorists](https://www.newsweek.com/chicago-police-union-leader-defends-capitol-rioters-there-was-little-destruction-property-1559835)? [Or that Capitol Hill police helped the mob, taking selfies and giving directions to Schumer's office](https://www.vox.com/2021/1/9/22222375/democrats-ryan-investigate-capitol-security-failings-trump-riot)?  Or that [84% of police voted for Trump](https://www.policemag.com/342098/the-2016-police-presidential-poll) in 2016? Where's Peter Parker whenever Spider-man shows up?

[The War on Professionalism | National Affairs](https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-war-on-professionalism) 
* Not a fan of any conservative-leaning magazine, but I don't think the pandemic has made anything clearer than the fact that a disturbing proportion of this country despises professionals (see: Dr. Fauci) and I'll take any piece that defends them. Maybe the whole "my opinion is as good as someone who's devoted their life to studying it" thing isn't surprising when social media collapses all tweets to the same level and influencers can make snappier youtube vids than any boring ol' scientist. What's interesting to me though is how you see Reddit, no fan of law enforcement, rooting so fiercely for the FBI right now even as we still hate the police. That's because the FBI are seen as professionals, and there's still a sense that even if the FBI is majority Trumpista just like the police, they'll do their duty. The idea of professionalism still matters in some corners.

[The Myth of the Alpha Male | Greater Good](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_myth_of_the_alpha_male)
* I listen to Scott Barry Kaufman's podcast sometimes, and even if I'm not interested in evo psych and think this study is pretty darn obvious to most heterosexual women, one of the aspects about the MAGA-hatters that I don't think is talked enough about is the gender angle. People who are drawn to authoritarians like Trump, Bolsonaro, Duterte et al also tend to hold pretty regressive gender views - they like their machismo, the fact that they "tell it like it is", and "boys will be boys" and "locker room talk" goes a long way into explaining why pussy-grabbing's never been a problem. There's a reason Trump supporters have such a massive venn diagram with redpillers and incels and obsess over military LARPing and being "alphas" instead of "cucks" and "betas". I would also bet you good $$ that there's an overlap with the dark corners of the weeb crowd, the ones that get obsessed with Asian women (and I say this as a weeb myself), which is why I was amused by this piece on [how bushido, instead of being the samurais' legendary code of honor, was fabricated in the past century as political propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/kcbgpt/how_bushido_was_fabricated_in_the_nineteenth/). 

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ks082p/meta_todays_sedition_at_the_united_states_capitol/gid3gd9/?context=1 - AskHistorians might be my favorite subreddit and this is a superb description of fascism. "Unlike the advocates of liberal democracy, it is not reason or modernization, which drives forward and unlike communists, it is not material relationships. For the Fascist the engine of history is conflict, whether between nations, peoples or races. History is a constant struggle in which a community of mythical qualities needs to assert itself in order to gain dominance over others. Dominance is the core goal and must be asserted. And only if the right and rightful people dominate will a golden age begin."

To be clear I don't want to draw ANY comparisons of BLM or left-wing protestors to white nationalist terrorists attempting a coup leading to the death of five people on account of a fake conspiracy theory spread by an orange dildo. But I've often thought about the
