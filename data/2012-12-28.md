I've been figuring out some healthy-ish dishes for myself:
* TJ's cauliflower fried rice with:
  * garlic
  * scallions
  * an egg
  * bacon/ham
  * peas
* egg white feta wrap: garlic, diced onions, mushrooms, spinach, egg whites, low-fat feta, oregano teaspoon
  * a few cherry tomato halves or sundried tomatoes
  * bacon for frying
  * garden vegetable cream cheese on a wrap
* all-veg salad: roast veggies (green beans, broccoli, carrots, asparagus), almond, avocado, cucumber cubes, tomato, spicy cashew dressing
* greek salad: cucumber, tomato, diced onions, romaine, olives



**Yes** list:
* Kayla and Matt
* Tingsley - told her to invite friends
* Liz Kim - told her to invite friends
* Andrea and Anthony

**Maybe** if they can test negative by Friday:
* Jacob 
* Kaypree (who'd prob come with Joe?)
* Yoni and Abby (but they're on molly)
* Tamar with her two siblings

**No:**
* Sagar
* Sagar's friends (not sure who) - at some twitter party
* Anthony
* Divya, Tom
