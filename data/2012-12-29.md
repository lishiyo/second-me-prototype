Sooo disappointed at Sagar dropping out.


Things to focus on next year:
* more Asian meetups/social events - ask Tingsley
* Spurs games at Flannery's
* Luke's running clubs
  * [NYC Fun Run (New York, NY) | Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-Fun-Run/)
  * [{chinatown} runners](https://www.chinatownrunners.com/) <- better
* real writing! bookclub bar, shut up and write etc
* EA/OBNYC events

**Yes** (11 up to 14 ppl):
* Kayla and Matt
* Andrea and Anthony
* Liz Kim with 3-5 friends (most likely 3), they're all boosted and tested - will likely be earlier in the night
* Rong
* Kaypree and Joe - will come early (9pm) "and stay till the 9th person" (lol) 
* Tingsley - but she hasn't given me a hard yes yet and prob has other offers so let's put this at 33% chance

**Maybe** (4-? people):
* Sagar and his friends - later in the night, he'll update me tmw
* Tamar and her brother and sister - 20% chance, prob later in the night
* Cynthia - if she can get a rapid test - 5% chance, it's way too much work to get a rapid right now
* Jacob - only if he can get a negative tmw morning, which I don't think so - 1% chance


**No:**
* Jacob - testing either tonight or Fri morning - probably a no
* Sagar
  * Sagar's friends - at some twitter person's party
* Anthony and Nicole
* Divya, Tom, John
* Akerr
* Eric
