A little mixed. I got up at 6am to try to catch our game with Crystal Palace but I got sooo sleepy I couldn't hang on studying. 

I had a weird dream about Dave and it was just a lot of what could have been. We were together but not together. I felt "hornier" than usual today.  Even started reading some yaoi manga and fanfic today!
