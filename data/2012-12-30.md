Hopefully Sagar and his crew can join us later in the night, along with Yoni and Abby.


I had an argument with Dave today about Andrea still testing positive even though she's past the quarantine and CDC says that is totally possible and it just frustrates me so much that he's a fucking hypocrite who won't test, doesn't ask his friends to test, but then becomes a big baby about someone who IS literally following the CDC guidelines.

Chasers

**Yes** (12-13 ppl):
* Kayla and Matt
* Andrea and Anthony - coming early
* Liz Kim with 5 friends, they're all boosted and tested - Junaid and Tina Lee, Sasha Raskin (single?), Genna Fukuda (bf out of town), Sojo Travis
* Kaypree and Joe - will come early (9pm) "and stay till the 9th person" (lol) 
* Tingsley - but she hasn't given me a hard yes yet and prob has other offers so let's put this at 33% chance
* Sagar and maybe his friends - will try to get here before midnight 

**Maybe** (4-? people):
* Tamar and her brother and sister - 20% chance, prob later in the night
* Yoni and Abby - 33% chance, 1 or 2 am

**No:**
* Rong - can't make it 
* Cynthia - if she can get a rapid test - 5% chance, it's way too much work to get a rapid right now
* Jacob - only if he can get a negative tmw morning, which I don't think so - 1% chance
