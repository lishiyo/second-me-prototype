It was actually kind of an amazing new years eve party at Dave's! I was so scared no one was gonna come and then the room just filled up (16 ppl at midnight):
* me and Dave - 2
* Andrea and Anthony -2 
* Kayla, Matt, Ashley - 3
* Kaypree and Joe - 2
* Liz, Genna, Sojo, Sasha and Pierce - 5
* Sagar and Jackie - 2

I *really* like Ashley, I think she's so bold and open in how much she likes you. I can tell that she is super protective and will destroy anyone who hurts her friends. She has a lot of Andrea energy.
