*More color and bigger toys yet somehow less sound and less fury*

tldr; Definitely not as good as the original and incoherent in character arcs and theme, but with more fleshed-out villains and still a few charming and effective scenes. Infamously over-long but I think issues run deeper than editing or scenes dragging.

**HUGE disclaimer**: I can't count myself as a proper fan of the franchise, or a comicbook person in general. I LOVED the first movie, but I know very little about Wonder Woman - every bit I do know comes from the previous movie and the DC movies, never the comics or the old Lynda Carter series. So I'm not coming at this from a fan's perspective, just a regular ol' movie-watcher hoping for a movie as good as the first. The peril of high expectations. Meanwhile the friends I watchpartied with were huge fans of the comics and Wonder Woman the character, and their verdict was overall pretty positive. No doubt there were a lot of references and callbacks I missed that made this movie more satisfying. This might be one of those "made for the fans" cases - if so, more power to Patty Jenkins and co! It just didn't hit home for me this time, though I don't regret giving up 2.5hrs of my, uh, *terribly* scarce time to watch it.

**SPOILERS BELOW**

![](2.%20Wonder%20Woman%201984/image.jpg)

There's a [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q00xTbIbUo) towards the end of the movie where Wonder Woman, armored in golden wings, faces off against her initial-rival-turned-secondary-villain Cheetah in a dark military base teeming with heights, electrical wiring, and conveniently a large pool of water at the bottom. 

This is the boss fight (well - sort of, since Max Lord is the big bad but not the kind who can mano-e-mano Wonder Woman), so of course there's a climactic speech. They didn't know each other for long, but it's clear there was the spark of something there - sweet, bumbling Barbara who worships the ground she walks on, triggering all of Diana's 'big sister' instincts on top of her general 'protector of humanity' ones. Something went terribly wrong, and Diana's here to fix it. To save Barbara. So it's in this final battle that we get what's to be the sum of this film, the theme that circles back to the beginning:

'Nothing good is born from lies. And greatness is not what you think.'

I don't hate this quote, even though I think it's pretty banal and painfully Hollywood, added to echo Hippolyta's quote at the beginning without actually earning that lesson for the character. But here's the problem for me: what does that actually say about Barb? 

Was her downfall to get tricked by the stone, a literal god of deception she accidentally touched? Or was it to *choose* beauty, charm, and confidence even at the cost of her own kindness for those invisible and discarded like her, because she wanted so bad to join the popular crowd? Which resonates more to you as a theme?

I find the latter more interesting, and that is why I can't get behind the headliner theme that "lying is bad". It doesn't land with me on any level - plot, story, *or* character. It's shallow and makes no sense to me as a character arc for a goddess whose most famous weapon is already the lasso of truth. 

Let's just take the plot-level: what does lying actually have to do what the villain's power? Isn't he *actually* granting them their wish (even if with a catch) so it's not really deceptive at all? The fact he doesn't talk about the cost makes it a kind of lie of omission, but that's not on the same level as young!Diana's "lie" which was active cheating. So the moral is, "you must tell the whole truth"? 

But more importantly, what is compelling about the theme that "lying is bad"? What is the conflict or complexity there? Doesn't every adult including Diana already know that lying is bad? There's a slight angle of self-deception, where Diana *knows* it's wrong to keep Steve at the cost of her powers, but it's resolved rather quickly and mostly by Steve himself. I love the simplicity and wholesomeness of Wonder Woman's character, I even loved the sentimental bits of this film, but I just find it such an inane thesis to have at the core of your movie. Even if it's dressed up more eloquently as "no true hero is born from lies". 

![](2.%20Wonder%20Woman%201984/maxresdefault.jpg)

I also think it's not what the content of the film actually wants to be. It's the text, but it's not the subtext. It's not even the substance. What I think the real theme this movie keeps making its way towards, awkwardly subsumed under the word "deception", is *sacrifice*. What are people willing to give up - or refuse to give up - for their dreams? What does that say about them? There's a kind of man who'd give up their body and health for power, respect, and money. I think we know them. Is there one thing, just one thing, they'd give up even those for?

If people just get tricked into their wish, that makes their final act one of realizing they'd been duped and renouncing that, which. . . doesn't really have any emotional impact? What if Maxwell Lord wasn't The Deceiver, but just a dude who gives people what they want, and the fundamental truth is that sometimes the things we want aren't actually good for us, or come at a cost we have to realize we aren't willing to pay. That makes the final scene one where the people around the world all *choose* to sacrifice their wishes after Diana's speech, giving up their deepest dreams to save each other. That feels pretty cheesy and Hollywood-contrived instead of realistic to me, but it also feels heroic. It feels 'great'. It fits in with Wonder Woman's core theme of choosing to put faith in a humanity that doesn't always show that it deserves her. 

Another way of putting this is "no shortcuts". Wishes are basically cheating - you're trying to get something for nothing. That ties it back nicely to the opening scene where child Diana get admonished for shortcutting at the last stretch, trying to get victory without effort. But even 'are you truly willing to sacrifice' doesn't quite land as a character arc to me. That is, is Diana's character arc supposed to be about accepting that she can't cheat her way to what she wants (Steve, alive and whole again)? But does that make sense for adult Diana, a superhero who's already defined by her honor and virtue? Are we supposed to think that she actually believes she *can* cheat the gods into keeping Steve, or that she really would ultimately pick him over all of humanity? 

I think it actually would be quite interesting if Diana were that kind of character, I just can't see that for her as-is. She's not a morally ambiguous or willing-to-bend-the-rules kind of character. What she struggles with, in my limited understanding of her through the modern DC movies and pop cultural osmosis, isn't about doing her duty, or telling the truth, or sacrificing her wants for the greater good.

What she struggles with, and what I think this movie initially grasps at saying, is *connection*. Diana is *lonely*. That's why she *gets* Barbara, that's why she tells her that "my life's not what you think", that's why she still holds on to this photo of a man she met over six decades ago. She's not close to anyone because outside one exception long ago in her early days, she's never opened that door to anyone. Her character arc, the way it was initially set up, was about opening herself up to connection - to make friends, to stop holding herself apart, to admit her loneness instead of putting up this self-prepossessed front that everyone admires from afar. That's what makes Barbara make sense as a villain, because she's Diana's foil - she's the one "cheating" her way to false connection by insta-turning hot, popular, and confident, and in doing so sacrificing the parts of herself that would have lead to *genuine* connection.

That's why I disagree with the reviews I've seen saying that it's "unfeminist" to have Diana 1) bond with Barb over boys and fashion and 2) still be pining over a cute pilot boy six decades later. First of all, I think it makes perfect sense for two women in the 80s who are meeting as strangers to pick "shallow" topics to talk about on their first "date" (what can I say, this film was great for shippers XD). (And quite frankly, me and plenty of women I know love giggling about this shit! We're not all debating the finer points of Sartre at wine club, you know.) 

The other thing it shows is that Diana has gotten SO good at camouflaging herself since the first movie. No one can tell that there's something up with this unbelievably smart, glamorous, self-confident woman; she lets them close enough to look, not close enough to touch. So on the other accusation - why is this goddess (literally *and* figuratively), who can have anyone in the world, still obsessing over one mortal dick? - I'm going to argue that's *exactly* why she's still obsessing. The thing is, Diana is a *goddess*. No matter how much she loves humanity, there will always be this thing separating her from humans. Not just the fact that they'll die in a blink just like Steve, but the fact that she has and will keep accumulating lifetimes' worth of experiences and memories, enough that it's hard to see a mortal man matching up to that. Maybe not even Steve, had he stayed past his few stolen hours on Earth.

That makes Diana a lonely character for me, as with most superheroes. But what makes her especially poignant is that she is genuinely a sweet, personable person, the kind who's willing to reach out to a shy newcomer at work even if she has no intention of becoming besties. She's also a serious person, who it's hard to see pursuing flings. By that I don't mean she's not lighthearted, but that she takes matters of the heart seriously. She's a born-and-trained *warrior*, who chose to make her primary duty protecting the weak. She was never socially-taught to desire men. She *stumbled* on Steve by total accident and experienced one real moment of innocent, irrational, selfish love and I kinda love her for never being able to let that go.

That's why, despite lacking in some of the humor and zip compared to the first movie, their scenes were still pretty effective for me. That bit in the plane that culminates in Diana finally finding her powers of flight is enormously gratifying: Steve's still helping her, if only through his good cheer and aw-shucks ease in his own abilities even next to a goddess. The fact that some of the human bits really landed for me (which includes the humanizing of the villains, who were much better done than in the first movie) means I don't feel completely disappointed in this film at all. It just sucks that all this build-up about Diana and choosing connection and saving Barb and used-car-salesman-Mando through that realization just... goes away. It gets completely lost in the second half, which is basically a big action fight with a lot of running around in the desert and the White House and some CGI straight out of Cats. It's like the producers panicked when they realized Wonder Woman had barely used her lasso yet and christ, how do you top an iconic WWI battle for visuals and stakes?? Dry up the rivers and unleash the zoos!

Don't get me wrong, that sequence in the desert was pretty cool (anything inspired by Fury Road can only be a good thing), and infinitely clearer editing than whatever was going on in DC. But all the leaning into the plot just exposes how bizarrely confusing the plot is. How exactly does Maxwell's power work? Why does he need to "touch" so many people to heal himself? How does it work when you have conflicting wishes? How does DC descend into chaos so quickly and why does that feel more like Jumanji than the end of the world?

Some of it was definitely my spotty stream, but I think a huge part of it is just that the plot doesn't fit with the theme. The movie keeps trying to wrap it all up with the neat little "it's all about lying" bowtie and that just pops up more question marks, with the biggest one being "so... what's the point?" It's like the writers knew they had to do a sequel, so they worked backwards from that to figure out what arc seems doable from the comics, instead of thinking about where they want to take this character first: what core character traits they actually want to grapple with, where they want Diana to be at the beginning and the end, what is going to give this stakes. Because usually the biggest stakes aren't about saving the world, but somewhere on the human level. 

Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm too old and grouchy to accept a film that's just good fun. Like I said I don't regret watching this even if it was too long, I just came in with higher expectations because the first film hit home like a landing beacon: funny, vivid, painting with all the colors of emotion. Defining Diana's light in one of the grimmest, most brutish periods of human history, in a way that recognized her gender and gave her a partner you could understand why she'd like. This film could've done with a better soundtrack and more inventive visuals (the Thor Ragnarok posters really threw me off there), and that would have helped, as would more wit and zest in the dialogue. But in truth I think the failure was more fundamental than that. This film needed more purpose and more heart.

As a generic movie-watcher and a big fan of the first film though, I felt that there were pretty bad fundamental issues with the script that couldn't be solved by a few decent action scenes (like the opening one - spectacular), good acting (Gadot and Pine have great chemistry as usual), and a wicked wardrobe. The main thing I couldn't get was the central theme about "lies", because it doesn't make sense on any level - plot, story, *or* character. First of all, on just the plot-level, what does that have to do with the villain's power? Isn't he *actually* granting them their wish (even if with a catch) so it's not really deceptive at all? 

But more importantly, what exactly is resonant about the theme that "lying is bad"? What is the conflict there? Doesn't every adult including Diana already know that lying is bad? There's a slight angle of self-deception, where Diana *knows* it's wrong to keep Steve at the cost of her powers, but it's resolved rather quickly. It's just such a weirdly childish, hokey conceit to have at the core of your movie.

What I'd say the real theme this movie wants, but for some reason awkwardly merges under "deception", is "sacrifice". I find it a lot more compelling to see what people are willing to give up - or refusing to give up - for their dreams, instead of being tricked into it. Maxwell isn't The Deceiver, he's just a dude who gives people what they want, and the fundamental truth is that sometimes the things we want aren't actually good for us, or come at a cost we realize we aren't willing to pay. That also makes more sense with the ending, where the final scene has people all around the world *choosing* to renounce their wishes after Diana's speech. That feels pretty cheesy and Hollywood-contrived instead of remotely realistic to me, but it does fit in with Wonder Woman's theme of choosing to put faith in a humanity that doesn't always show that it deserves her. Which is the wholesome core in her character that I've always kinda liked in an age of cynical or at least flawed heroes.

"No shortcuts" is another way of putting this. Wishes are basically cheating - you're trying to get something for nothing. That helpfully ties it back to the opening scene where child Diana get admonished for shortcutting at the last stretch. But it still doesn't really make sense as a character arc to me - is Diana's character arc supposed to be about accepting that she can't cheat her way to what she wants (Steve)? But that doesn't make sense for adult Diana because she is already honorable and virtuous - are we supposed to think that she actually believes she *can* cheat the gods into keeping Steve? Or that she'd really ultimately pick him over all of humanity? I can't see that for her character. What she struggles with, in my limited understanding of her through the modern DC movies and pop cultural osmosis, isn't about doing her duty, or sacrificing her wants for the greater good.

What she struggles with, and what I think this movie initially tries to grasp at saying, is *connection*. Diana is *lonely*. That's why she *gets* Barbara, that's why she tells her that "my life's not what you think", that's why she still holds on to this photo of a man she met over six decades ago. She's not close to anyone because outside one exception, she's never opened that door to anyone. Her character arc, the way it was initially set up, was about opening herself up to connection - to make friends, to stop holding herself apart, to admit her sadness instead of putting up this self-prepossessed front that everyone admires from afar. That's what makes Barbara make sense as a villain, because she's Diana's foil - she's "cheating" her way to false connection by snapping her fingers to turn hot, popular, and confident, and in doing so sacrificing the parts of herself that might have lead to *genuine* connection.

That's why I disagree with the reviews I've seen saying that it's unfeminist to have Diana 1) bond with Barb over boys and fashion and 2) still be pining over a cute pilot six decades later. First of all, I think it makes perfect sense for two women who are meeting as strangers to pick "shallow" topics to talk about on their first "date". Especially in the 80s.

What it also shows is that Diana has gotten SO good at camouflaging herself since the first movie. No one can tell that there's something up with this unbelievably smart, glamorous, confident woman. So on the other critique - why is this utter goddess (literally *and* figuratively), who can have anyone in the world, still obsessing over mortal dick? - I'll argue that's *exactly* why she's still obsessing. The thing is, no matter how much Diana loves humanity, there will always be this thing separating her from other people. Not just the fact that they'll die just like Steve, but the fact that she has and will keep accumulating lifetimes' worth of experiences and memories, enough that it's hard to see a mortal man matching up to that. Perhaps not even Steve, had he stayed past his few stolen hours on Earth.

(Even more simply, has Diana ever seemed the relationship-pursuing type? She's a warrior who's chosen to make her primary duty protecting the weak. She *stumbled* on Steve by total accident and experienced one real moment of innocent, irrational, selfish love and I kinda love her for never being able to let that go.)

So basically, lacking in humor though they were compared to the first movie, their scenes were still pretty effective for me; I especially loved that bit in the plane culminating in Diana finding her powers of flight. The fact that some of the human bits worked on me (which includes the humanizing of the villains, who were much better done than in the first movie) means I don't feel completely disappointed in this movie.

It gets completely lost in the second half, which is just a big dumb action fight with some running around in the desert and some CGI straight out of Cats.

The movie keeps trying to wrap it all up with the neat little "deceit" bowtie and that just pops up more question marks, with the biggest one being "so... what was the whole point?" It's like they knew they had to do a sequel, so they worked backwards from that to figure out what arc seems doable from the comics, instead of thinking about where they want to take this character first. But I think we are past the point of accepting a comicbook film if it has some decent fights and the proper look. We also ask for some character work and oftentimes at least a dash of wit and good fun, like Thor Ragnarok or Spiderman: Homecoming. Even Birds of Prey offered a great soundtrack and some wild visuals. This film needed less script-by-committee, and more invention and more heart.

* Okay there were some scenes that were still pretty moving, like when Diana had to give up Steve again and where she learned to fly. And I appreciated that the villains came from a relatable place, I am basically awkward!Barb and Pedro Pascal's character is just a used car salesman, he does still have some redeeming qualities like his son. But I don't understand the central theme about "lies" at all and how that has anything to do with the villain's power - isn't it a given that lying is bad? Isn't he *actually* granting them their wish (even if with a catch) so it's not deceptive at all? What I'd say the real theme is is "sacrifice".  I find it a lot more powerful to see what people are willing to give up -- or refuse to give up - for their dream, instead of being tricked into it. The final scene of people all choosing to renounce their wishes after Diana's speech strikes me as super cheesy and Hollywood-contrived instead of remotely realistic. But it does fit with Wonder Woman's theme of loving and putting faith in humanity. 
  * "no shortcuts" is another way of putting the theme. Wishes are basically cheating - you're trying to get something for nothing. But this is a pretty trite theme that doesn't make sense as a character arc. That is, is Diana's character arc supposed to be about accepting that she can't cheat her way to what she wants (victory, Steve)? But that doesn't make sense for adult Diana because she is already honorable and virtuous. A theme that would make more sense as a character arc would be accepting connection - to not keep herself apart, to make friends (like Barbara!), to be open to love again. To do that, she has to be vulnerable in a way that she hasn't allowed herself since Steve. Barbara is the foil - she's "cheating" her way to (shallow) connection by instantly turning hot, popular, and confident, and in doing so sacrificing the aspects of herself that might lead her to genuine connection. 
* The editing definitely needed work though part of the problem was our terrible stream. I was super confused by some of the villain's power especially the Middle East scenes and how DC descended into chaos so quickly. How exactly does Maxwell's power work? Why does he need to "touch" so many people to heal himself? And how does it work when you have conflicting wishes?
  * They should've leaned more on what people view as their most precious thing because that was character-revealing - Barbara's is her empathy, Maxwell's is his body (and then his son), Diana's is apparently her powers? 
  * The action sequences are okay, the best one was the opening sequence and the Fury Road-esque fight in the desert. Nothing as iconic as the No Man's Land scene though.
* It's kind of interesting to have two villains too and I don't know if they really fit together. I understand Barbara as a foil for Diana but it's not really well executed - it should've leaned more on the loneliness theme. She never renounces her wish while at least Maxwell gets a kind of character arc.
* I've seen some reviews say that it's "unfeminist" to have Diana bond with Barbara over boys and fashion and still pine for Steve six decades later. I disagree with this because 1) plenty of us like to talk about those things! there's nothing wrong with it and they talk about geeky archaeology stuff too; and 2) the fact that she still thinks about Steve is what gives her immortal character a humanity.
  * I'm not interested in some Strong Female Character who can get over someone and pursue whoever she likes. Diana is confident and self-prepossessed but, like she tells Barbara, there's a part of that that's an image - she's not really close to anyone herself because outside one exception, she's never opened that door to anyone. The thing is, Diana is a *goddess*. No matter how much she loves humanity, there's always this thing separating her from mortals (even if she *were* interested, why would she ever date another man when he'll just die?). She's a warrior who's never been interested in pursuing relationships, she *stumbled* on Steve by total accident and experienced one moment of real love and I love her for never being able to let that go.
  * That's why Barbara/Cheetah is the villain in this movie, because that's the vulnerable, human part of Diana's character: her loneliness. That's what they have in common, the longing for connection.  I wish this movie had more of that and less random mall action sequences.
