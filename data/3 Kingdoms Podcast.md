### Episode 1

Introduces the damnable eunuchs, the omens leading to the fall of the Han and the start of the Yellow Turban rebellion
* example: eunuch demands a bribe from the commander putting down the rebellion, when he refuses on account of there being no provisions the eunuch goes back and smacktalks him as a coward
* omens - serpents galore, especially the black serpent

Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, Guan Yu - hilarious descriptions, Guan Yu at 7'2"? what's up with the long lobes?
* Liu Bei was pro-dynasty, ANTI rebels 
* Liu Bei has a pretty classic underdog arch - he's the scion of a noble house fallen into destitution

Intro to Cao Cao - he's a playboy who's also supposed to be filial? Into poetry and the arts, always skipping his studies etc. Tricks his dad into distrusting his uncle - obviously a bad egg from the start.
