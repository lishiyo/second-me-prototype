I had a weird year in books. I'm not a "reading challenges" or "goals" kind of reader - I pick up whatever sounds interesting (usually because I just heard about it on some podcast or article) and make my way a third in before getting distracted by another rec popping up on the radar. I do most of my reading at night, which means opening up my kindle in bed and skipping past the Good Books in my queue to some dubious YA or Naruto fanfic I can doze off to. In between I supplement with bookclub books to pretend I can haz discipline. 

This year though, three things happened:
* I got a trial run of Kindle Unlimited which I was determined not to buy in the end (damn you Bezos!), which meant I had exactly three months to read the entirety of Amazon
* I started writing fanfic again, which besides being disastrous to my sleep also demanded a fair amount of research into Bangkok, [Thai social structure](http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Thailand/sub5_8c/entry-3228.html), organized crime in Asia, acting methodologies, social engineering, and the setup of reality TV dating shows 
* oh, and a little virus showed up

Besides shutting down things like restaurants, get-togethers, and commutes, COVID-19 brought me back to my parents' burbs. With what looked like a sudden surplus of time and a dramatic deficit of fun, I decided I was totally going to make a "pandemic playlist" and read all the books I'd been meaning to - books like *War and Peace*, *East of Eden*,  The Foundation Trilogy and so on:

(truncated to spare you the rest of the categories)

As you can tell from the lack of checks, that didn't really work out. But I did read a lot! Or rather, I finished a lot - a whole bunch of the books I was a third of the way through, I finally made lists of those lists and knuckled down. At one point I'd locked myself in the far bathroom, the one that didn't have wifi, to feverishly flip through some book about trees. 

You see, what happened was I discovered the Goodreads Reading Challenge, and desperately needed a way to cheat at it. That meant wrapping up books I was close to, picking shorter books and YA junk I could crunch through like a snickers, and finally, when I was despairing at the end, realizing I could add every single volume of the manga series Alice in Borderland and they'd each count as one book.  I calculated percentages left against readinglength.com. I read nonfiction while watching soccer games (less of a mental load), cut out fantasy (too much mental load), and speed-appreciated a book of poetry while brushing my teeth. I was a product massaging its own KPIs. 

So I wouldn't call my Year in Books a success, though 100 books is something that's always been on my bucket list so I'm glad I finagled my way to the finish line. And I did read a number of  genuinely great, or at least interesting, books! Here's a list of categories I made up:

Favorite scifi/speculative:
* The Dispossessed (Ursula Leguin) - I can't believe it took me so long to read this, I often (shamefully) find Leguin's books a bit slow and dry to push through but this actually hit me in the feels, besides all the thinky political stuff. (Not to mention, gave me the *delightful* insult of "propertarian"). In my old notes I wrote: "The most resonant part of the book for me is the way this works on an emotional level, not just a critique of anarchist vs capitalist society. . . There is something about Shevek that is fundamentally different on a human level, that makes you think he‚Äôd be an outsider in *any* society. Even in a society that tries as hard as possible to be communitarian like Annares, he struggles to not be a loner. . . There is a way in which we don‚Äôt want to be owned by our things, but we do want to be possessed by *people*. Shevek‚Äôs fundamental ‚Äúflaw‚Äù is that he was dispossessed by his mother. There‚Äôs a way you can‚Äôt share love the way you can share possessions - that‚Äôs a human thing, not a political thing. No matter how free your society is, or how painstakingly equal, people want to be special to someone."
* runner-up: does Gideon the Ninth (Tamsyn Muir) count as scifi? It's a brilliant mash-up that I can only describe as "necromantic rival lesbians investigate a mystery in space." It's wickedly funny, inventive, and a thick, dense, deliciously-Latin read that actually had me running for the dictionary. The swords and magical skeletons scream fantasy, and the imperial houses Game of Thrones, but the whole space-thing is pretty scifi. 

Favorite fantasy:
* Green Bones Saga, books I and II (Fonda Lee) - I became so obsessed with this alternate-universe-HongKong/wuxia/gangster fantasy that I ended up using it for an AU in some of my fanfic üòÇ  It's the story of two warring families and their rise and fall. The worldbuilding is ambitious and glorious but where it really executes is the way it makes you feel something about the characters, whether in a good or bad way - I'd hate Hilo one second and the next I'd follow him to the grave. 
* runner-up: Circe (Madeline Miller) - I didn't read much fantasy this year and don't know if this feminist retelling of a Greek myth really counts, but the sheer poetry of her prose is something else; it blows my mind that we share the same language. Just take a look at the [quotes](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/53043399-circe?page=1). My favorite passage was the one where Odysseus's son Telemachus, a new stranger to her shores that Circe regards with rightful wariness, describes how his father - Circe's former lover - made him hang the slave girls for sleeping with the suitors. "I had some thought that it must be more proper. I should used the sword instead. I have never known such ugly, drawn-out deaths. I will see their feet twisting the rest of my days. Goodnight, Lady Circe."

 Favorite general fiction
* Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits (David Wong) - this one might fall a little into scifi/comics/YA territory, it's about a trailer-park girl who discovers her father was basically the guy in Bioshock (rich, criminal, an Ayn Randite) after his death. She inherits an empire in Cyberpunk City and has to fight a bunch of superpowered incels. It's just a wild ride that had me in stitches for a good chunk of it, though I would suggest the extremely online would appreciate this book more than most.
* runner-up: Tokyo Vice (Jake Adelstein) - I can't attest to the accuracy of this journalist's time on the vice beat in Japan (one suspects it's rather touched up) but it's very entertaining. The years he worked in Japan overlaps with my dad's, and his descriptions of Japanese society back then really line up. I didn't know anything about the police, the yakuza, or the sex work industry in Japan so that was really surprising, nothing like I'd pictures. 

* Favorite non-fiction
  * The Light that Failed (Ivan Krastev) - I know this is an *incredibly* niche topic - why has Eastern Europe shifted rightwards instead of embracing Western "freedom and democracy" since the fall of the Soviet Union - but it actually has a lot of insight into things going on here with neoliberalism and Trumpism. The rise of nationalist, populist figures around the world is one of the most urgent questions for me right now and this goes deep into the undercurrents: the politics of imitation, the unspoken preoccupation with demographic collapse, the emigration of the 1989 "winners", the distinction beween democracy and liberalism. The new anti-liberals, as modeled in Viktor Orban, are primarily railing against multiculturalism and individualism in favor of traditional communitarianism. This is not another battle between capitalism vs communism, it's about how people see their identity.
  * runner-up: War (Sebastian Junger) - The author's other book, Tribe, is actually well worth reading beside to The Light That Failed. I liked that book a lot and was a little wary of this one, but it's not a ideological or a pro-military book, though it does head to the battlefield; like his previous book, it's much more about community and the human need for belonging, and the role that combat plays from the anthropological perspective. I took a class called "The Sociology of War" and this reminded me very much of the things my professor would say, that war is awful and no one advocates it of course, but there is a way that the extreme pressure also brings out the *peak* of humanity. In war we are capable of more than we ever imagined, for good and ill.   

* Favorite history book
  * Voices from Chernobyl (Svetlana Alexievich) - I picked this up after the HBO series and after reading it, immediately had to grab all of Svetlana Alexievich's other books. The series is loosely based off this book but it has so many more stories from the ordinary people who were there. If you love Studs Terkel, you'll love this one. 
  * runner-up: Defying Hitler (Sebastian Haffner) - I think I've read this in piecemeal over the years and just finished in early 2020. So I can't remember it well, but this is such a fascinating situation - it's an eyewitness account from 1939 of an anti-fascist in Nazi Germany, watching his countrymen descend into fascism. Not that that would resonate for any reason right now...

* Favorite memoir/essays/biography:
  * On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous (Ocean Vuong) - I'm the last person to read this book because I'm awful - at first I thought the prose was a little *too* poetic and metaphorical for me, verging on purply, so I dropped it years ago but I picked it up again this year. And I'm very glad I did - it builds up momentum as Ocean starts excavating his own life and the Trevor chapters legit had me in tears. What gets me is that everyone talks about this as the Vietnamese American experience, and yes the violence of the war carves a deep ripple in every figure, but it's also a really, really good memoir about opioid country. It's whatever Hillbelly Elegy was trying to do, but not just about white people in the boondocks. It's like we forget that poverty, trauma, and fentanyl aren't the sole preserve of the MAGA-hatters. But some people took up hedge funds and blaming the poor for their "culture", while others became poets who trace the rivers of despair to their origins. 
  * runner-up: Minor Feelings (Cathy Park Hong) - my initial reaction to this was a bit ambivalent as well, because I personally don't feel like I've ever experienced much racism as a Chinese American, or at least it'd pale in comparison to other groups who face *real* struggle. But that's exactly it - those doubts and deflections are the "minor feelings" that Cathy Park Hong is talking about. Her observation that Asian American writers so often try to strip out markers of race to avoid being branded as "identitarians" for example really struck me. I grew up reading Western books; I can't even imagine having an Asian American main character, that feels disturbingly self-insert-y to me, but why? The essay collection has so much history on Asians in America that I didn't know - for example, that "Asian American" is an invented category from the late 60s, one that contains more income inequality than any other racial category in America. I'm not a "political" person, I still think most of my personal conflict comes from a *universal* challenge of growing up in a different culture inside the house to the one outside rather than a *particular* form of racial edifice, but I appreciate the questions that she raises. 



* Biggest surprise
  * Alice in Borderland (Haro Aso) - I never read this because I always hated the covers (the art was so bad and it looked like a Gantz knock-off), but the Netflix show got me into it. It's a lot closer to one of my favorite series, Liar Game, than I expected: a loser young man who plays video games all day suddenly finds himself in what looks like a video game - an empty Tokyo, where mysterious arrows lead them to "games" the survivors have to solve to avoid a giant laser blasting a hole in their head from the sky. Most of these gory games are puzzles that can be solved with teamwork and your brain, but others require an understanding of human nature; most of those are about being able to manipulate people, but the most sadistic ones are about genuinely loving people. The side stories are really my favorite part because you get to see different characters' motivations from a different angle as you try to figure out what connects all of them - that is, *why* these particular people ended up in Borderland and what the whole point of these games are.
  * runner-up: The Lightning-Struck Heart (TJ Klune) - ok this went on WAY too long but I was expecting some generic slash fantasy and it actually turned out to be kind of hilarious and wholesome. Think Camelot, but funny and gay and populated by hunky knights named Ryan. 

* Biggest disappointment
  * Conversations with Friends (Sally Rooney) - for a topic I'm not usually into (romance? but more a book on love than a romance book) Rooney's previous book Normal People utterly seized me. So I picked this up pretty eagerly . . . and almost threw it across the room by the end. I loathed the main character so much I could barely finish it, she's a woman in her twenties with the emotional acuity of a 12-year-old who's used to things just . . . happening to her, someone who's never realized she can actually assume authorial control of her own life. Not once does she ever reflect on whether she should feel bad for her adultery. It just . . . happens, and he's cute and she's horny so let's continue. That might be a refreshingly different POV (and a realistic one, because no doubt there's plenty of people out there who genuinely don't feel bad for sleeping with another woman's husband), but every other character was also terribly self-absorbed and flimsily sketched. I'm not one of those who can appreciate a book or show where I hate everyone in it. 
  * runner-up: the ending of Liar Game (Shinobu Kaitani). I went back and finally finished the last few volumes this year after consuming all of Alice in Borderland in one night and craving more dystopic-puzzle-game series. I don't know if the editor was forcing him to finish in 10 chapters, but it was obviously rushed and the final answer to the purpose of the games was painfully unsatisfying (and my little shipper heart was left unsatisfied, sigh). On the whole however, this is one my favorite series and I recommend it to everyone. 

* Most Useful Read
  * The Fire Next Time (James Baldwin) - also read Notes of a Native Son. Besides getting to peek into a brilliant, rigorous mind, it's painful to realize how applicable this still is to 2021. My favorite chapter is the one on his father, who he examines under such a cool, clear, and objective yet human lens that you understand everything about him and why Baldwin may have such complicated feelings towards him in a matter of pages. 
  * runner-up: Why We're Polarized (Ezra Klein) - I'm listen to a lot of Ezra Klein's podcast (balancing it out with Robert Evans' podcasts, which are a bit more openly anti-establishment dirtbag left), so I had a good idea of what his book would be about. The wonk in me was still pleasantly surprised at just thoroughly researched it is though, it's chock-full of studies and references and an investigation of history. One of the shockers that I learned is that 57% of whites think that discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and minorities... which ok I accept for boomers, but 48% of white MILLENNIALS think so too. Klein has an optimistic temperament so he can't help but end on a "we can still things around!" chapter but I admit I'm way less optimistic - there's plenty we could do, but only if we get out of this negative feedback loop.


* Book that Still Makes Me Think
  * A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters (Julian Barnes) - what an odd, unusual, enigmatic book that wanders through curious fables to historical retellings to nonfiction essay. The central conceit is that of Noah's ark - every story has something to do with the ark or the animals or the idea of faith. The technique is motif, I've always found Barnes highly readable even if I wasn't into the story, but the way everything fit together left me scratching my head. A lot of the stories seem utterly pointless, or only fainly connected to the ark, but you get the sense there's a lot more there to chew on. The one chapter that's singular because it's a personal essay is an absolute beauty: it's on love, and you know that here is the core of whatever it is Barnes is tring to say, something like history is only tenuously connected to objective truth but the beliefs that man has - beliefs like god, or survival, or love - become truth, but I haven't thought hard enough to make a case. 
  * runner-up: Tiger Writing (Gish Jen) - I haven't read enough (read: any) Chinese lit to speak informatively on Gish Jen's examination of Western vs Eastern forms of narrative, but her observations about the cultures ring very true to me. She has this very striking motif from her father's autobiography about how obsessed it was with the many doors in the house that he grew up in, which sounds terribly dry at first but actually reveals so much about the social context in their choice of when to open and close, and in what number. It's always interesting to realize that the culture you grew up in, the books you grew up consuming, isn't the universal, or the default, but one of many alternatives; from another perspective, the Western focus on individual experience and character development has its power but might also de-emphasize other, also interesting, things. Here's a review if you're interested: [‚ÄòTiger Writing,‚Äô by Gish Jen - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/books/review/tiger-writing-by-gish-jen.html).
