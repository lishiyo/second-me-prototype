[[FOOD LOG: 2022]]
[[Standups - March 2022]]

That was a really interesting date today, with Asher. I keep comparing him to Dave and I can't get over this feeling of "pity" I have for him because of his disabilities (spinal problems, stutter, the child abuse) but I also have a lot of respect for how sharp and resourceful he is. I think I need someone more "normal" and a little endearing like Dave but at least he's kind of interesting?

I'm just so sick and tired of being someone's friend. I've been "someone's friend" for 32 years. I want to be someone's partner. I don't want to be "good, but not good enough", I don't want to be the placeholder girlfriend, I don't want to keep giving away my affection to everyone around me because I have too much of it that has nowhere to go. I'd rather be alone than be second best, even if that means I'll be alone forever. 

I feel like people enjoy my time, affection, and companionship, but without the accountability of a relationship. I kind of have to draw a line in the sand and just not give that away anymore. I don't really want more friends. I want a real partner. I have to prioritize that and just
