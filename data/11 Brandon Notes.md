# 1:1 Brandon Notes
#coding/tumblr

name and pronunciation

when do you typically work? any variation?
- 10-6 pretty common, I usually step out for a run/gym around lunch hour, sometimes I like to work at night if I have an appointment or errand during the day

what do you like to work on? dislike?
- like: bugs, debugging, anything api layer or user-facing (love being a product engineer)
  - 
- dislike: tumblrpay/billing system issues, not familiar with the wordpress code but it just seemed incredibly messy

how do you prefer to work? (e.g., deadlines, alone vs together, interruptions)
* I like it when we're all hustling together in real time on Slack - trying to discuss on p2 is hard
* nice having a backend partner like Wes because we could review each other's PRs quickly

how much input do you prefer to be able to provide for decisions?
* depends on the actual context! for product facing features I love being able to work with the designer on ideas. For areas I'm not super familiar with I am happy to step back.

what are your skills? weaknesses?
* skills: 
  * I've been at Tumblr for a long time so I've seen a lot of different parts of the codebase, though more recently have been a bit silo'ed
- weaknesses - haven't touched much core PHP work so things like kubernetes and working at scale, don't know anything about the search side

how do you deal with being stuck/unhappy/frustrated?
* take a walk
* try to be quick about asking for help - usually it's a waste of time if I'm banging on my head

how do you prefer to **receive** feedback?
* positive?
  * recognition in slack, Rocco for example is great about giving thanks
* critical?
  * real-time, instant, not delayed to a feedback review
  * I've liked our project retros because it's oftentimes a team effort and gives us an opportunity to all reflect on how we could've done better 

how do you prefer to **give** feedback?
- retros - team effort
- private DMs, less formal than a peer feedback review

what do you wish your past leads would have done more of? less of?
- MORE: clearer and stricter deadlines would've been helpful to figure out workloads we needed to target. For example, sometimes we'd get lost in the weeds on this one edge case, if there was a stricter deadline, maybe we could say backlog this, don't spend too much time on it.
- LESS: 

where are you in your career?
* what are your short- and long-term goals? (6 months, 1 year+)
  * 

what were you working on most recently? is there still work to be done?
* Post+ - take over
* Premium 

recording of our team syncs
* notes are more valuable than video - AI summaries?

any blockers?

anything else?
